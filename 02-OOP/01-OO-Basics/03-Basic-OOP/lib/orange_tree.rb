#You should be able to measure the tree
#Each year, the tree should age (it becomes older and taller, and eventually dies).
#A tree grows 1 meter per year until 10 years old. Then it stops.
#Before 50 years old, the proabability of dying as a year pass is zero.
#After 50 years old, the probability of dying increases
#No tree can live more than 100 years
#A tree will produce 100 fruits a year once it is 5 years old
#A tree will produce 200 fruits a year between 10 and 15 years old
#A tree will not produce any fruits after that
#You should be able to pick an fruit from the tree
#You should be able to count how many fruits on the tree there are left
#Every year, fruits which were not picked just fall off
